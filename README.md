# DS3231-RTC
augmented existing library to include Alarm1 functions 

This library allows to controll the DS3231 Real Time clock. The original author did not provide any functions to control the first Alarm but this alarm has some interesting modes, therefore I added functions to use the first alarm.
Aditional info (on which the library is bases) can be found at https://datasheets.maximintegrated.com/en/ds/DS3231.pdf
